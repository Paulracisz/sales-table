<h1>Sales Table - a data sorting table app</h1>

<h2><a href="https://paulracisz.github.io/sales-table/" target="_blank">Deployed website available here.</a></h2>
<p>The goal is this application is to create a data table that can sort dynamically, and render dynamically. There is 4 quarters in a year, and each quarter will display the 3 respective months of the 12 month data table. The sales header when clicked will toggle between 3 states. Sorting of the sales numbers by descending, ascending, and then back to the default chronological order. The two sorting headers also work intermittenly with the quarter filters as well, so the application will dynamically sort the 3 months that are being displayed. The top salesperson header is also another header that when clicked toggles between 2 states. The two states are sorting alphabetically from a-z of the names of the top sales person of that month, to back to chronologically, the default state.</p>
